This is a simple command-line-based Number Guessing Game written in C++.
The game allows the user to choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. 
Depending on the difficulty level chosen, the game generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.
After each guess, the program provides clues about whether the guess was too low or too high.
